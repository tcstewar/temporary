      "\n",
      "We present a neurally inspired control system that adapts to unknown dynamics and unknown kinematics.  This control system is an adaptation of Cheah, Liu, and Slotine (2005) adaptive tracking control, adjusted to allow for extremely power-efficient implementation using analog neuromorphic hardware.  We demonstrate the performance of the algorithm in simulation and in a physical instantiation.  Furthermore, we show that the components of the algorithm can be implemented in extremely noisy, low-power, sub-threshold logic."
